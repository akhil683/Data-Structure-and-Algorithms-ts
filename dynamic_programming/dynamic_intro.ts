//NOTE: DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:

//It is an optimization technique.
//Used to solve problems by breaking it down to a collection of sub-problems.
//Solving each of those sub-problems just once and
//storing their solutions in case next time, the same sub-problem occurs
//thus saving computationsl time.

//NOTE: Key Concepts

//Optimcal Sub-structure
//Overlapping sub-problems
//Memoization
//Tabulation
